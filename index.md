I'm a software engineer, writer, and website-haver based in Miami, FL.

I received my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Since then I've worked primarily in web development in the startup environment. Most of that can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickmccrea/){:target="_blank"}. I also built [Recursor](https://recursor.nickmccrea.com/){:target="_blank"} and [sobot-rimulator](https://github.com/nmccrea/sobot-rimulator){:target="_blank"}.

I'm into space travel, AI, urban development, Miami history, and lots of other stuff. In my spare time I am co-creator of [_Story of Miami_](https://www.storyofmiami.com/){:target="_blank"}, a Miami history serial podcast.
