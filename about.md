I'm a software engineer and website-haver from Miami, Florida.

I've worked at a few startups, lived abroad as a digital nomad, and attempted a couple ventures of my own. If any of that interests you there's more info on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickmccrea/){:target="_blank"}.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2010. I'm into space travel and the future of cities. I'm also a co-creator of [_Story of Miami_](https://www.storyofmiami.com/){:target="_blank"}, a Miami history serial podcast. I have a fat cat named Mr. Snuggles.
