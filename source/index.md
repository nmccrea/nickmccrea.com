I'm a computer engineer, writer, and website-haver based in Miami and the Space Coast of Florida.

I like to build things that work. I like to solve problems that have never been solved before. You guys aren't going to believe this but I like to think outside the box.

The soul of an axe is to chop. The soul of an engineer is to reduce complicated problems into elegant and useful abstractions. My work is grounded in rigor and first principles, and the ongoing mastery of investigation, reduction, design, prototyping, testing, and iteration. I deliver tractable systems that work the way they're supposed to.

I'm into space travel, AI, robotics, urban development, Miami history, and lots of other stuff. I once built [Sobot Rimulator](https://github.com/nmccrea/sobot-rimulator){:target="_blank"} and [Recursor](https://recursor.nickmccrea.com/){:target="_blank"}. I'm also co-creator of [_Story of Miami_](https://www.storyofmiami.com/){:target="_blank"}, a Miami history podcast.
